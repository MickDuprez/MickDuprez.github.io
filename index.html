            Introducing MetaCAD, the revolutionary new CAD application that is currently under development and set to take 3D
            modeling, BIM, and user customization to the next level.</p>

<p>With MetaCAD, you can expect to easily create complex 3D models with intuitive tools and a user-friendly interface. The
application's powerful BIM capabilities will allow you to design and manage buildings and infrastructure with precision
  and efficiency.</p>

<p>But what really sets MetaCAD apart is its extensive customization options. Using JSON and JavaScript/TypeScript, you
will be able to tailor the application to your specific needs and workflow, making it the perfect fit for any design
professional. And with cloud-based model data storage powered by MongoDB, you'll be able to access your projects from
  anywhere, on any device.</p>

<p>We are currently seeking supporters and donations to help bring MetaCAD to market. If you believe in the power of this
innovative new application, please consider supporting us and helping us bring MetaCAD to the design community.</p>

<p>Whether you're an architect, engineer, or designer, MetaCAD will have everything you need to bring your vision to life.
Keep an eye out for its release and be one of the first to try it out and see the difference for yourself.
